## Introduction to MapReduce Algorithms: Model, Constant Rounds, and Impossibility


`Yufei Tao` - **School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland.**

This short lecture will introduce students to MapReduce algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We will start by defining the massively parallel communication (MPC) model, which serves as a popular computation model for analyzing the performance of MapReduce algorithms. One important efficiency measurement, both in this model and in practice, is the number of "rounds" performed by an algorithm. We will discuss a number of problems that can be settled optimally in a constant number of rounds, and also problems that cannot.


## 	Network Mining and Analysis for Business Applications


`Feida Zhu` - **Singapore Management University.**

The recent blossom of social network and communication services in both public and corporate settings have generated a staggering amount of network data of all kinds. Unlike the bio-networks and the chemical compound graph data often used in traditional network mining and analysis, the new network data grown out of these social applications are characterized by their rich attributes, high heterogeneity, enormous sizes and complex patterns of various semantic meanings, all of which have posed significant research challenges to the graph/network mining community. In this lecture, we aim to examine some recent advances in network mining and analysis for social applications, covering a diverse collection of methodologies and applications from the perspectives of event, relationship, collaboration and network pattern. We would present the problem setting, the research challenges, the recent research advances and some future directions for each perspective.


## Geospatial Information Management


`Cyrus Shahabi` - **University of Southern California.**

Geospatial information, in the form of traditional maps, has been used for several centuries for decision making tasks. The oldest map is known to be from 2500 B.C. of a city near Babylon. In the past forty years, the field of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS), with ESRI leading the industry, has been increasing the role of geospatial information in decision making tasks by allowing their digital manipulation. However, it was not until early 2000’s that the power of digital geospatial information has been brought to mass population through online map services such as Yahoo-map and later Google-Earth and Microsoft Virtual Earth. Nowadays, you cannot see a news story without a screen-shot of Google Earth. According to US Department of Labor, the market for geospatial technologies in 2002 was estimated at $5 billion.

The focus of this course is on studying techniques to efficiently store, manipulate, index and query geospatial information in support of real-world geographical and decision-making applications. In this course, the students become familiar with a variety of geospatial applications (e.g., location-based services, online maps) and datasets (e.g., road-network data). Topics include: Object-Relational and Spatial Databases (e.g., Oracle 11g), Spatial Index Structures (e.g., Quadtrees, K-d Trees, One-dimensional Orderings, PK-Trees, R-Trees), Spatial Queries, and some advanced topics in spatial data management. 

The course assumes that students are familiar with conceptual data modeling tools such as Entity-Relationship (ER) data model, logical data models such as the relational and object-relational data model, SQL3 as a commercial query language, normal forms and logical data design, physical design of a database using persistent data structures such as B+-tree and Hash indexes, transactions, concurrency control and crash recovery techniques.
